Problem 1: Clustering, Problem 2: CART-RF-ANN


## Data Mining 

Categorically falls under predictive analytics and is fundamentally associated with information discovery in databases. Data Mining aims at finding useful patterns from large data sets in an attempt to make data more informative and qualitatively insightful. The value of patterns discovered from mining the data enables businesses to make effective data-driven decisions and develop a sustainable competitive advantage. Applications of data mining can be found in e-commerce, social welfare, politics, terrorism, sales and marketing, finance, operations, etc.

we explore how this field brings together techniques from statistics, machine learning, and information retrieval. We will discuss the main data mining methods currently used, including clustering, classification, decision trees, and random forest.

## Project Objectives

Build Models using Clustering, Classification Tree Techniques, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks
Understand key statistical measures to be observed when building models and ensure model robustness

## Project Content

Clustering (Hierarchical and non-hierarchical)
Decision Trees (CART)
Random Forest
Artificial Neural Networks
Model Performance Measures

## Problem 1: Clustering

A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers. They collected a sample that summarizes the activities of users during the past few months. You are given the task to identify the segments based on credit card usage.

## Problem 2: CART-RF-ANN

An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.
